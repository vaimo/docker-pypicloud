## Generating Passwords

```shell
$ docker run --rm -it joshbenner/pypicloud gen-password
```

Enter the password twice. An encrypted value will be printed that can be put in the `PYPI_ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable. It will look something like:

    $6$rounds=704055$kq8HTiZC50zoffwq$T335/H9UxRegwAxcuTUggt.ip2CBpP18wTxOAGpK8DLBZ3jC2yVklFQxRtOd5tHqmzaxDIuq0VUJb/lzaLhNW0

## SSL Termination

Terminating SSL at a proxy or load balancer is recommended. However, SSL options are available if you require SSL termination at the container:

```
PYPI_SSL_KEY=/certs/mysite.key
PYPI_SSL_CRT=/certs/mysite.crt
```

These paths must be available to the application running inside the container at runtime.
